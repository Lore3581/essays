# Introduction

The Emergent Strategy Writing Collective seeks to utilize collaboratively written fiction to imagine, create, and communicate new possibilities and considerations for our world.

This project seeks to find five to ten writers who would like to envision a shared new world together; each writer then gets to create a thoroughly-developed character to immerse within that storyworld and through whose perspective their contributions will be told.

The specifics of the storyworld, as well as the pacing for writing this project, will all be determined by the participating writers.

# Fiction-Writing Through Collaborative Ideation

Historically, must collaborative writing has taken the form of the anthology. Although anthologies can be an effective writing method—of collecting stories from a series of authors, shared together in a unified work to often suggest or explore a larger theme—they still rely on an individualism of creation. The stories may support or renegotiate each other, but they frequently exist within contained worlds as imagined by the solitary authors who wrote them.

Fiction-writing through collaborative ideation[^1] draws from adrienne maree browns ‘notion that the “more people who cocreate the future, the more people whose concerns will be addressed from the foundational level in this world.” By collaborating with other writers to determine the rules and structures within the storyworld, to redefine social values and rewrite them to consider new ways of existing and coexisting, and to inhabit this storyworld through personal and meaningful characters, collaborative ideation allows authors to collectively imagine together. 

# The Premise

Although much of the specifics will be settled by participants, there have been a few considerations pre-determined to help anyone considering joining decide if this project is a good fit for their writing objectives.  

## The World

The story will draw upon speculative science-fiction to consider an alternate version of Earth at an unspecified moment in the future where crucial diverges—either in technology, politics, culture, or society—have caused the storyworld to diverge in notable ways. While this alternate earth approach may limit collaborative ideation, it also allows all writers to enter into the project from a preexisting understanding of the world, not having to confer with each other about every little detail during the actual writing process itself. 

If participating writers begin to find this work limiting and determine it is worthwhile to invest the additional time and resources into creating a new world or mode of existence, that is absolutely a possibility! 

## Character Relationships

In every realistic rendition of humanity, character complexity, unique relationships, and conflict will always emerge. The objective is not to eliminate these human dimensions from the storyworld through ideation but instead suggest ways they can be communicated, explored, and settled. 

It is a primary goal of the Emergent Strategy Writing Collective to depict liberated relationships, or relationships that are based on three of brown’s noted attributes: radical honesty,[^2] acknowledging power dynamics and keep growing,[^3] and relinquishing Frankensteinian notions of creating or fixing others.[^4]

Additionally, the Emergent Strategy Writing Collective hopes to consider generative conflict relationships—including, borrowing one of brown’s prompts, “How would we handle conflict and difference in our ideal world?”[^5]

When conflicts do arise between these characters, there is also an opportunity to explore transformative justice, which, as brown describes them:
•	“Acknowledges the reality of state harm.
•	Looks for alternative ways to address/interrupt harm, which do not rely on the state.
•	Relies on organic, creative strategies that are community created and sustained.
•	Transforms the root cause of violence, not only the individual experience.”[^6]

# Creating More Possibility

How can we envision, create, and build upon new possibilities? It is crucial to consider and assess our ability to do so. Because of this, the first workshop of the Emergent Strategy Writing Collective will address our own capacities for creation and possibility; each member will be prompted to come with the answers to the following questions suggested by brown and ready to discuss them:

•	“What are all of your gifts?”
•	“Are you living a life that honors all of your gifts?”
•	“If yes, how did you create all this possibility for yourself?”
•	“If no, how can you create more possibility today? Tomorrow? This month? This year?”[^7]

Building upon this foundation will hopefully allow each new participant to share their gifts and strengths, which might be able to guide following conversations about organizing logistics. 

# Logistics

This work seeks to generate a meaningful collaboration, which brown envisions as “the stronger the bond between the people or groups in collaboration, the more possibility you can hold.” With this consideration in mind, the writing workshops organized for the Emergent Strategy Writing Collective will not be entirely grounded in the work we hope to accomplish together but also getting to know one another, so we can notice who we are instinctively drawn towards and how we create and cultivate ease together.

In addition to strategically making progress towards our goals, this collective also has the potential to provide a secondary function: a learning community.[^8] This possibility will be discussed once participants have joined and matters like time commitments have been decided; if members decide to proceed with this possibility, specific texts related to the storyworld being developed will be chosen and responded to by the collective.

Speaking more practically, a lot of the logistics will be negotiated and determined by the participants within this project. More specifically, members will determine which technologies to support shared work[^9] they want to utilize, concepts like brown’s tools for emergent strategy facilitation—including “trust the people,” principles, protocols, and consensus—will be discussed and navigated together. Vision, mission, intentions, decision-making processes, and agendas will all be collectively mediated.

Lastly, the potential for annual advances and retreats can be addressed once the more recurring logistics are finalized.[^10]

# Conclusion: “All Organizing is Science Fiction”

In their collaboration for Octavia’s Brood: Science Fiction Stories from Social Justice Movements, adrienne maree brown and Walidah Imarisha articulated “all organizing is science fiction,” a term that means “social justice work is about creating systems of justice and equity in the future, creating conditions that we have never experienced”[^11]—and these systems and conditions must be imagined before they can be realized.

The intention of the Emergent Strategy Writing Collective is to rely on collaborative ideation, the concept of “all organizing is science fiction,” and any other concepts and considerations drawn from brown’s writings on emergent strategy to create a meaningful and compelling story as told from various character perspectives and authors to imagine possibilities and envision new worlds we could be bold enough to strive toward.

> "Fiction that centers those who are currently marginalized —not to be nice, but because those who survive on the margins tend to be the most experientially innovative—practicing survival-based efficiency, doing the most with the least, an important skill area on a planet whose resources are under assault by less marginalized people. Visionary fiction is constantly applying lessons from our past to our future(s). The best way to practice visionary fiction is to get to writing. […] You have worlds inside you. You have permission to share them.” — adrienne maree brown in _Emergent Strategy: Shaping Change, Changing Worlds_

[^1]: adrienne maree brown‘s definition of collaborative ideation: “At the human scale, in order to create a world that works for more people, for more life, we have to collaborate on the process of dreaming and visioning and implementing that world. We have to recognize that a multitude of realities have, do, and will exist. Collaborative Ideation is a way to get into this—ideation is the process of birthing new ideas, and the practice of collaborative ideation is about sharing that process as early as possible. This is not to say there is no space for individual creation—I love the selfishness of closing the world out and unleashing the realm of my imagination and creativity. But how do we disrupt the constant individualism of creation when it comes to society, our shared planet, our resources? The more people who cocreate the future, the more people whose concerns will be addressed from the foundational level in this world.” adrienne maree brown, _Emergent Strategy: Shaping Change, Changing Worlds_ (Chico, CA: AK Press, 2017). <br>

[^2]: adrienne maree brown‘s definition of radical honesty: “No omissions, no white lies, no projections. Ask the questions you really want answered, speak your truth, and let the relationship build inside all that reality. […] the more you practice this, the more you will find yourself spending your waking hours in the ways you want to, the ways that honor the miracle of your existence, which was not given to you to waste in polite avoidance of hurting people’s feelings. You will find that you can be honest and kind, you can be honest and compassionate.” adrienne maree brown, _Emergent Strategy: Shaping Change, Changing Worlds_ (Chico, CA: AK Press, 2017).<br>

[^3]: Furthermore, adrienne maree brown‘s adds: “Have an understanding on the front end of the race, class, gender, ability, geographic, and other power dynamics that exist between you. And also remember that these are constructs. Be in the complexity of living inside these constructs while evolving beyond them through relationship.” adrienne maree brown, _Emergent Strategy: Shaping Change, Changing Worlds_ (Chico, CA: AK Press, 2017).<br>

[^4]: By this adrienne maree brown is referring to: “You are not creating people to be with, or work with, some idealized individuals made of perfect parts of personality that you discovered on your life journey. You are meeting individuals with their own full lives behind and ahead of them. Stop trying to make and fix others, and instead be curious about what they have made of themselves.” adrienne maree brown, _Emergent Strategy: Shaping Change, Changing Worlds_ (Chico, CA: AK Press, 2017).<br>

[^8]: adrienne maree brown on one opportunity of a learning community: “Responding to common text is a great way to do this. And it doesn’t have to be just a reading group—it can be a group that watches films, listens to music, or compares experiments in changing movement practices.” adrienne maree brown, _Emergent Strategy: Shaping Change, Changing Worlds_ (Chico, CA: AK Press, 2017).<br>

[^9]: adrienne maree brown’s brief thoughts about technology to support shared work: “Basecamp, OpenOffice, Yammer, Whatsapp, Secret Facebook groups, cel.ly, internal blogs, shared calendars—there are a lot of apps and resources out there to support shared work. Figure out which ones will be most helpful to you” adrienne maree brown, _Emergent Strategy: Shaping Change, Changing Worlds_ (Chico, CA: AK Press, 2017).<br>

[^10]: adrienne maree brown specifically “recommend[s] that any group of people working together over time schedule regular time for reflecting on and evaluating the work done, harvesting the lessons and applying them to future iterations of the work. For organizations, I recommend three or four annual advances. (Calling them “retreats” when they are work sessions is disingenuous. Plan retreats too! Just don’t confuse them.) One can focus on reflection and evaluation; one can focus on applying lessons from reflection to the next period of time (planning); and one can be about big vision, meta discussions of the work, the field, the patterns emerging, skill development. Looking back, looking ahead, looking up and down.” adrienne maree brown, _Emergent Strategy: Shaping Change, Changing Worlds_ (Chico, CA: AK Press, 2017).<br>
